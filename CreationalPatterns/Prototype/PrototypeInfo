The Prototype Method design pattern belongs to the Creational patterns family.
It allows creation of new objects based on a known prototypical instance.

It is useful when:
	We anticipate the creation of many objects with the same properties.
	We anticipate the creation of clones of various instances.

The example used in this project:
	A strategy game allows us to create different types of units.
	Each new unit created will have its own instance but has to be a clone of the created type.
	The user, in this current stage of the game, may create Archers/Infantry/Knights.
	A prototype of each unit type is stored in the user's barracks (UnitPrototypesCache object)
	and on each creation request a new clone is created and sent to the field.
	
The structure and pattern participants in this example:
	Prototype: Unit
	ConcretePrototype: Archer, Infantry, Knight
	Client: UnitProrotypesCache
