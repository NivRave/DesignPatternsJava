The Adapter Method design pattern belongs to the Structural patterns family.
It converts the interface of a class into another interface the client knows.

It is useful when:
	We need to adapt the output/input to a new client.
	We need to adapt the output/input of a new component.
	Create a new, common interface between different collaborating components.

The example used in this project:
	Our system knows how to process fitness data in a EU metric format but we work with
	an external customer that only provides data in a US metric format. We use and adapter
	to covert the US units to EU units that our system knows to get the correct results.
	We convert mph->kmh and pounds->kg 
	
The structure and pattern participants in this example:
	Target: IEUFormat
	Adapter: formatAdapter
	Adaptee: IUsFormat
	Client: user on Main file.
