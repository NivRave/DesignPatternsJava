<h1>Design Patterns project - Java with easy examples</h1>

This is a small project i'm working on while taking an academic course called "Software Engineering" - where one of the fields we study is design patterns.
During that course we mostly deal with pseudo code and C# examples and most examples are technological and hard to relate, so i have decided to improve my skills by writing the patterns from scratch using JAVA, while improving others' understanding by providing clear, easy-to-relate-to examples for each design pattern.

<h2>The examples used in this project:</h2>
<h3>Behavioral Patterns:</h3>
Command - simple calculator
Iterator - fan requests to a celebrity
Observer - stock market investors
State - football game tactics
Strategy - navigation routes system
Template - computer strategy games playing

<h3>Creational Patterns:</h3>
Abstract Factory - restaurant with meat/veggie meals
Builder - burger restaurant with several meal combinations
Factory - shapes creation
Prototype - strategy game army unit creation
Singleton - a multiple users system's logger

<h3>Structural Patterns:</h3>
Adapter - US to EU metrics unit conversion
Composite - operating system file storage structure
Decorator - honda cars
Proxy - server actions with different permissions

If that mini project will help even only one person it will be amazing!
