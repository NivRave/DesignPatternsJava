The Decorator Method design pattern belongs to the Structural patterns family.
It allows behavior to be attached/added to an object dynamically.

It is useful when:
	Objects' behavior can be extended during runtime

The example used in this project:
	Our nice, old fashioned Honda is great with its stock components.
	If we install turbo, we add it to our car and than it almost flies!
	
The structure and pattern participants in this example:
	Component: ICar
	ConcreteComponent: HondaCar
	Decorator: CarDecorator
	ConcreteDecorator: TurboCarDecorator
