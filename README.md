# Design Patterns project - Java with easy examples
This is a small project i'm working on while taking an academic course called "Software Engineering" - where one of the fields we study is design patterns.
During that course we mostly deal with pseudo code and C# examples and most examples are technological and hard to relate, so i have decided to improve my skills by writing the patterns from scratch using JAVA, while improving others' understanding by providing clear, easy-to-relate-to examples for each design pattern.

If that mini project will help even only one person it will be amazing!
