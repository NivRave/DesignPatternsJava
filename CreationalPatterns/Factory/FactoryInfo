The Factory Method design pattern belongs to the Creational patterns family.
It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
It is useful when:
	A class can't anticipate the class of objects it will create
	A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
The example used in this project:
	Creating a shape factory object to create different shapes with known size and drawing each,
	without defining specific shapes, just the IShape object, until the moment of creation.
The structure and pattern roles in this example:
	Product interface: IShape
	Concrete products: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle
	Creator/Factory: ShapeFactory
