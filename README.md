<h1>Design Patterns project - Java with easy examples</h1>

This is a small project i'm working on while taking an academic course called "Software Engineering" - where one of the fields we study is design patterns.<br />
During that course we mostly deal with pseudo code and C# examples and most examples are technological and hard to relate, so i have decided to improve my skills by writing the patterns from scratch using JAVA, while improving others' understanding by providing clear, easy-to-relate-to examples for each design pattern.

<h4>Each pattern is located inside a folder/package with a matching name.</h4>
<h4>Each patten has a PatternInfo.txt file that has the information about the specific pattern and its implementation</h4>

<h2>The examples used in this project:</h2>
<h3>Behavioral Patterns:</h3>
Command - simple calculator<br />
Iterator - fan requests to a celebrity<br />
Observer - stock market investors<br />
State - football game tactics<br />
Strategy - navigation routes system<br />
Template - computer strategy games playing<br />

<h3>Creational Patterns:</h3>
Abstract Factory - restaurant with meat/veggie meals<br />
Builder - burger restaurant with several meal combinations<br />
Factory - shapes creation<br />
Prototype - strategy game army unit creation<br />
Singleton - a multiple users system's logger<br />

<h3>Structural Patterns:</h3>
Adapter - US to EU metrics unit conversion<br />
Composite - operating system file storage structure<br />
Decorator - honda cars<br />
Proxy - server actions with different permissions<br />

If that mini project will help even only one person it will be amazing!
